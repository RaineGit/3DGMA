## 3DGMA is a 3D game maker that runs on Android devices
I am not working on this project anymore, feel free to resume its development.


## IMPORTANT:
1. Use Unity 2019.2.6f1 (2019.2.6), the C# compiler that 3DGMA uses doesn't seem to work on newer Unity versions.
2. Have in mind that the project is a complete mess.
3. The model importer that 3DGMA uses (TriLib) won't work because I couldn't upload to Github some files it needs for working. You should reinstall TriLib manually.
