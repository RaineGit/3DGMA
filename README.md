# IMPORTANT:
### 1. Use Unity 2019.2.6f1 (2019.2.6), the C# compiler that 3DGMA uses doesn't seem to work on newer Unity versions.
### 2. Have in mind that the project is a complete mess
### 3. The model importer that 3DGMA uses (TriLib) won't work because I couldn't upload to Github some files it needs for working.
